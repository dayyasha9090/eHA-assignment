        Basic Info
    </h3>
    The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate
    mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a
    small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses
    around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies
    caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses
